        <p style="color: beige"> There's nothing much on what we do after lunch. We just get rest and mind our own business, some of them watching television and like, me is just chilling on the couch with my phone.</p>
        <p style="color: beige"> Around 4 p.m, we started to move again maybe having a high-tea or usually for me, I will go helping my father to do some cleaning outside the house. My nephew also go outside to play pretty much during that time we try to do something making our move.  </p>
        <p style="color: beige"> At night, we having dinner and this is where I spend most of the night in my room while others maybe at the living room watching TV. Sometimes I can be productive but also sometimes I'm not. </p>
        <p style="color: beige"> That is pretty much how's my day going on during MCO and it pretty much repeated on the next day and I can say most of my time I spend in my room. </p>
